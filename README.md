## Introduction

Data communication is an essential part of modern technology and involves encoding and decoding data for reliable transmission. This repository serves as a central resource for various tools and utilities related to source encoding, channel encoding, and line encoding/decoding.

## Tools

The following tools are included in this repository:

- **Source Encoding/Decoding Tools**: Tools for encoding data at the source, such as data compression algorithms.

- **Channel Encoding/Decoding Tools**: Tools for encoding data for transmission over a communication channel and decoding it on the receiving end, including error correction codes.

- **Line Encoding/Decoding Tools**: Tools for encoding data for transmission over a physical communication line (e.g., electrical signals) and decoding it on the receiving end.

Each tool is organized into its own directory within this repository.
